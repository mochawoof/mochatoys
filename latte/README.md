## I want to contribute!
Contribution is welcome! Just make sure to:
- Keep pull requests descriptive but to the point. If you changed too much to be able to describe it concisely, consider splitting it up into different requests.
- Discuss with the mainainer(s) before adding any external dependencies. Try to find built-in solutions if possible to help keep latte small and fast.
